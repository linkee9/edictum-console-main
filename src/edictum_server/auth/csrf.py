"""CSRF protection middleware for cookie-authenticated endpoints.

Uses the custom-header pattern: mutating requests (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH) that
rely on cookie auth must include ``X-Requested-With`` header.  Browsers block
cross-origin requests from setting custom headers unless CORS allows it, so
a forged form submission from another origin cannot include this header.

API-key-authenticated requests (``Authorization: Bearer edk_*``) are exempt
because they don't rely on ambient cookies.  External webhook callbacks
(Telegram, Discord, Slack) and the login/setup endpoints are also exempt.
