"""Regression test: static assets under /dashboard/assets/ must be served with
correct MIME types, NOT as text/html from the SPA catch-all.

Root cause (2026-03-12): the @app.get("/dashboard/{full_path:path}") catch-all
was registered before app.mount("/dashboard/assets", StaticFiles(...)), so every
CSS/JS request got index.html with text/html — blank white page in production.
