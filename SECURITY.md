# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Edictum, please report it responsibly.

**Email:** [security@edictum.ai](mailto:security@edictum.ai)

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Response Timeline

| Stage | SLA |
|-------|-----|
| Acknowledgment | 48 hours |
| Triage and severity assessment | 7 days |
| Fix for critical/high severity | Best effort, typically within 30 days |

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest release | Yes |
| Older releases | Security fixes only, on a case-by-case basis |

## Scope

This policy covers:

- **edictum** -- core Python library ([GitHub](https://github.com/edictum-ai/edictum), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/edictum/))
- **edictum gate** -- coding assistant governance layer (`pip install edictum[gate]`)
- **edictum-console** -- self-hostable operations console (this repo)

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service disruption
- Only interact with accounts they own or with explicit permission
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and provide sufficient detail for reproduction
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before a fix is available

## Security Design

Edictum's core enforcement is designed around these principles:

- **No LLM in the enforcement path.** Contracts evaluate tool names and arguments against YAML conditions using deterministic pattern matching. The evaluation pipeline never calls an LLM.
- **Fail closed.** Contract parse errors, type mismatches, missing fields, and unhandled exceptions in the pipeline all result in deny decisions. The agent never silently passes when the system encounters an error.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The core library has no third-party dependencies, minimizing supply chain attack surface.
- **Automatic secret redaction.** API keys, tokens, passwords, and connection strings are redacted from audit events and denial messages before they reach any sink.
